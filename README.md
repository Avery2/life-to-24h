```
Write in plain html js, a visualization of mapping a lifetime into normal 24 day. So like it starts at 12am. Have a slider to set current age, and buttons + slider to set max life.

So like [assume 80 years, changeable by buttons to other presets] and you are [40, set by slider that goes from 0 to 80] it would be 12pm.
```
